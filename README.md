# MLZoomcamp Movie Rating Predictor

## Overview

This project aims to train a Machine Learning (ML) model that predicts the rating of a movie based on various features such as movie title, release year, runtime, revenue, popularity, overview, and other relevant metadata. The model serves as a useful tool for recommender systems, film analysis, or providing quick movie rating estimates for new releases.

The model is built using XGBoost, a powerful gradient boosting library, and is served as a REST API using the Flask framework. The API can be used to get predicted ratings for movies given appropriate input features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle:

- **Source**: [TMDB Movies Dataset 2023 - 930k Movies](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asaniczka/tmdb-movies-dataset-2023-930k-movies)
- **Description**: This dataset contains metadata of approximately 930,000 movies, including features like movie titles, production companies, genres, release dates, budgets, and more.

### Download Data

Since the dataset is quite large, download it directly from Kaggle. You can either use the command below or manually download the available zip file.

```python
import kagglehub

# Download latest version
path = kagglehub.dataset_download("asaniczka/tmdb-movies-dataset-2023-930k-movies")

print("Path to dataset files:", path)
```

After downloading, copy the movie dataset CSV to your working directory:

```commandline
cp <path-to-dataset-files>/<movie-file>.csv <home-dir>/tmdb-movies.csv
```

> Ensure that the `tmdb-movies.csv` dataset is present before proceeding with the next steps.

## Setup / Installation

### Clone the Repository
First, clone this repository to your local machine and navigate to it:
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd mlzc-movie-pred
```

### Install Dependencies
To set up the environment, you will need to install the necessary dependencies. It is recommended to use `poetry` or any virtual environment tool of your choice.

#### Using Poetry
- If `poetry` is not installed, install it from [Poetry Installation Guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/).
- Use the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

This command will create an isolated environment and install all required packages, enabling you to run the notebooks and the Flask API server.


## About the Project

### Version History

- **Version 1**:
  - **Analysis**: `movies.ipynb` contains the initial data analysis and model development. This version did not generalize well during testing.
  - **Model File**: [movie_rating_pred_v1.bin](movie_rating_pred_v1.bin)
  - **Training Script**: `src/train.py`
  - **Prediction Script**: `src/predict.py`

- **Version 2**:
  - **Refined Analysis**: `movies_redefined.ipynb` includes improvements related to feature engineering and code structure. Worked further on improving the model with XGBoost.
  - **Model File**: [movie_rating_pred_v2.bin](movie_rating_pred_v2.bin)
  - **Training Script**: `src/train2.py`
  - **Prediction Script**: `src/predict2.py`

> **Note**: The Docker setup currently points to Version 2 of the model for serving predictions.




## Running with Docker

For ease of deployment, a Docker container is provided to package the environment and the model:

### Build Docker Image
```bash
# Build Docker Image
docker build -t movie-rating-predictor .
```

### Run Docker Container
```bash
# Run Docker Container
docker run -it --rm -p 9696:9696 movie-rating-predictor
```

This will start the API server inside the container, listening on port `9696`.

## Usage

### Accessing the Prediction API in Python/Notebook Environment
You can interact with the API via HTTP requests. Below is a sample Python code to send a movie's metadata for rating prediction:

```python
import requests
import numpy as np

# Sample movie for prediction
movie = raw_df.iloc[23].to_dict()

# Replace NaN values with None to avoid JSON serialization issues
for key, value in movie.items():
    if isinstance(value, float) and np.isnan(value):
        movie[key] = None

# Define the API endpoint
host = "0.0.0.0:9696"
url = f'http://{host}/rate'

# Send POST request for prediction
response = requests.post(url, json=movie)

# Output the response
print(response.json())
```

### Sample Response
```json
{
  "movie_title": "I Am Omega",
  "predicted_rating": 5.78
}
```

### Example Input
The following is a sample movie input that can be used to test the API:

```python
movie = {

}
```

## Training the Model

If you need to train the model, you can modify the training script and run it locally:

### Train the Model
Make sure you are inside the poetry environment or have all dependencies installed.

```bash
poetry shell
python src/train2.py
```

This will retrain the model and save the updated version, which can then be used to rebuild the Docker image.

### Changing Model Code
To change the model code or update features, modify the following files:
- **Training Script**: `train[version].py`
- **Prediction Script**: `predict[version].py`

After modifying the code, rebuild and redeploy the Docker image to apply changes.
